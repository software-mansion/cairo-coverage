## Installation

To install the latest stable version of `cairo-coverage`, run:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

If you want to install a specific version, run the following command with the requested version:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.1.0
```

## Usage

### Generate coverage report

To generate the report, run `cairo-coverage` with one or more `<PATH_TO_TRACE_DATA>` arguments, which specify the paths
to the json files containing the trace data to be used for generating the coverage report.
Optionally, you can provide the path to the output file using `--output-path <OUTPUT_PATH>`. If not specified, the
output file will default to being saved as `coverage.lcov`.

### Output format

The generated output file is in the `lcov` format. For your convenience, you can find an explanation along with a simple
example of the `lcov` format [here](./lcov.md).

#### Example

```shell
cairo-coverage path/to/trace/1.json path/to/trace/2.json path/to/trace/3.json
```

### Usage locally

A summary report with aggregated data can be produced by one of many tools that accept the `lcov` format.
In this example we will use the `genhtml` tool from the [lcov package](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/tree/master) to generate an HTML report.

Run the following command in the directory containing your `coverage.lcov` file:

```shell
genhtml -o coverage_report coverage.lcov
```

You can now open the `index.html` file in the `coverage_report` directory to see the generated coverage report.

## Usage in GitHub actions

A variety of GitHub actions are available for analyzing coverage data for continuous integration purposes, which can
accept input in the form of an lcov file.
Examples of such actions include [CodeCov](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action)
and [Coveralls](https://github.com/coverallsapp/github-action).

The example workflow below illustrates how to use coverage report generated by `snforge` in conjunction with `CodeCov`:

```yaml
name: Example cairo coverage workflow
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: foundry-rs/setup-snfoundry@v3

      - name: Install cairo-coverage
        run: curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

      - name: Run tests and generate report
        run: snforge test --coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          file: ./coverage.lcov
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

## External tools integration

`cairo-coverage` is tool-agnostic which means that it accepts input from any tool. However, these tools need to generate
trace data in a specific expected format -
the same format which is accepted by the [cairo-profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler/tree/main).
For the exact code implementation of this format, please refer
to [this page](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler/blob/main/crates/trace-data/src/lib.rs).
