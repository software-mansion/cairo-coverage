# cairo-coverage

`cairo-coverage` is a utility designed to generate coverage reports for code written in the Cairo programming language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this repository is actively being developed and is currently in an alpha release stage.

## Installation

To install the latest stable version of `cairo-coverage`, run:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

If you want to install a specific version, run the following command with the requested version:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.1.0
```

## External tools integration

`cairo-coverage` is tool-agnostic which means that it accepts input from any tool. However, these tools need to generate trace data in a specific expected format -
the same format which is accepted by the [cairo-profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler/tree/main).
For the exact code implementation of this format, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler/blob/main/crates/trace-data/src/lib.rs).
For a practical example of how this format appears in a file, consider examining [this json file](./crates/cairo-coverage/tests/data/test_project/snfoundry_trace/tests::test_call::my_test.json).

## Integrated tools

[//]: # (TODO: Update the link below)
- [x] [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) - check how to use it with `cairo-coverage` [here](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/snforge-advanced-features/profiling.html)

## Usage

### Output format

The generated output file is in the `lcov` format. For your convenience, you can find an explanation along with a simple example of the `lcov` format [here](./lcov.md).

### Generate coverage report

To generate the report, run `cairo-coverage` with one or more `<PATH_TO_TRACE_DATA>` arguments, which specify the paths to the json files containing the trace data to be used for generating the coverage report.
Optionally, you can provide the path to the output file using `--output-path <OUTPUT_PATH>`. If not specified, the output file will default to being saved as `coverage.lcov`.

#### Example

```shell
cairo-coverage path/to/trace/1.json path/to/trace/2.json path/to/trace/3.json
```

### Coverage statistics

Various tools exist that can produce coverage statistics based on an lcov file. One of the most well-known among these is [genhtml](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/blob/master/bin/genhtml),
a tool that generates an html summary report using the coverage data in an lcov file, `genhtml` is part of the [lcov package](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/tree/master).

## Usage in GitHub actions

A variety of GitHub actions are available for analyzing coverage data for continuous integration purposes, which can accept input in the form of an lcov file.
Examples of such actions include [CodeCov](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) and [Coveralls](https://github.com/coverallsapp/github-action).

The example workflow below illustrates how to use coverage report generated by `snforge` in conjunction with `CodeCov`:

```yaml
name: Example cairo coverage workflow

  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: foundry-rs/setup-snfoundry@v3

      - name: Run tests and generate report
        run: snforge test --coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          file: ./coverage.lcov
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```
